# Project Overview

This repository includes three distinct projects, each with its own focus and objectives:

## 1. Handwritten Text Author Identification

**Overview**: This project aims to identify the authors of handwritten text using **Compact Convolutional Transformers (CCT)**. It addresses the challenge of varying handwriting styles and enhances the accuracy of author identification through efficient data processing and advanced models.

## 2. User Interface Code Generation from Hand-Drawn Sketch

**Overview**: This project develops a machine learning-based system to generate HTML/CSS code from hand-drawn sketches of user interface layouts. By automating the translation of design sketches into functional code, it streamlines the development process and reduces the time from design to deployment.

## 3. Chess Game Development with C++ and SDL

**Overview**: This project involves creating a chess game using **C++** and **Simple DirectMedia Layer (SDL)**. It features a graphical user interface, game logic for standard chess rules, and a variety of chess puzzles to enhance gameplay and provide engaging challenges.
